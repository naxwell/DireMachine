# DireMachine

The Dire Machine is an experimental VR Horror experience where the player, locked into a chair IRL, must navigate through audio and visual clues in VR to release themselves before *something* reaches them. The intention is to create a high tension environment where the line between the game experience and the bodily experience is blurred.
